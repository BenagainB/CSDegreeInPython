# Data Structures

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_Two/Year_Two.md)

## Section Description

Learn fundamental abstract concepts of data structures as well as their implementation in a programming language. Topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing, recursion, complexity analysis of algorithms, and binary trees.

## Suggested book 

> *Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (Developer's Library)* (1st Edition) by John Canning, Alan Broder, Robert Lafore • ISBN-10:013485568X • ISBN-13:978-0134855684

## Topics Covered 

*   Link list
*   Recursion
*   Algorithm analysis
*   Stack
*   FIFO queue
*   Sorting
*   Hashing
*   Binary trees

## Learning Outcomes 

*   ~~Write a basic program with multiple design patterns that models familiar computational behavior whose implementation is likely not familiar or understood~~
*   ~~Interpret requirements and specifications, get clarification on anything unknown or uncertain, and translate them into a solution~~
*   ~~Make use of industry-standard data formats to become familiar with processing them in a flexible manner through design patterns~~
*   ~~Develop a structurally complex solution using design patterns to manipulate realistic language-based programming constructs~~
*   ~~Accommodate and enforce appropriate interconnections among a relatively large set of heterogeneous object types with various constraints~~
*   ~~Develop a software solution in a team environment that utilizes versioning for code organization amongst team members~~
*   ~~Develop a software solution in a team environment that utilizes unit tests to validate important methods, modules, and components that are part of the solution~~
