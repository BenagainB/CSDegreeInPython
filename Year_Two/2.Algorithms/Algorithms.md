## Section Description

This course studies data structures and algorithms, with emphasis on non-linear data structures such as trees and graphs, and algorithmic strategies such as divide-conquer and dynamic programming. Basic algorithm analysis skills will be introduced and practiced through the learning of various data structures and algorithms on the foundation of the asymptotic notations.
