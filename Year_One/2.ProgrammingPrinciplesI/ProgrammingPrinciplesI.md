# Programming Principles I

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_One/Year_One.md)

## Section Description

This course covers the concepts and practices of information representation, computer algorithms, hardware organization and computer program design and implementation. Students write, run, debug, analyze and evaluate computer programs. Topics include primitive data types, number systems, file I/O classes, control structures, method design and usage, array–sorting and searching algorithms. Programming projects are required.

## Prerequisites

Fair understanding of basic Algebra and Order of Operations

## Suggested book

    *	Linear and binary search (iterative version)
    *	Basic sort (selection and/or insertion)
*   Enumerated Data Types 
    *   Basic Creation
    *   Constructor
    *   toString
    *   ordinal vs other value

### Key Concepts:
*   


## Learning Outcomes 
* design a program based on a specification document
* write, compile and execute a complete program that reads from a file
* write, compile and execute a complete program that will simulate a “has-a” relationship
* design a program implementing the comparable interface
* design a program that overrides the equals method
* design a program that overrides the hashCode method
* write, compile and execute a complete program that will utilize static methods
* write, compile and execute a complete program that will utilize an array
