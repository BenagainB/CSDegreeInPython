# Programming Principles I

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_One/Year_One.md)

## Section Description

This course covers the concepts and practices of information representation, computer algorithms, hardware organization and computer program design and implementation. Students write, run, debug, analyze and evaluate computer programs. Topics include primitive data types, number systems, file I/O classes, control structures, method design and usage, array–sorting and searching algorithms. Programming projects are required.

## Prerequisites

Fair understanding of basic Algebra and Order of Operations

* write and execute a complete program that will simulate a “has-a” relationship
* design a program implementing the comparable interface
* design a program that overrides the equals method
* design a program that overrides the hashCode method
* write and execute a complete program that will utilize static methods
* write and execute a complete program that will utilize an array
