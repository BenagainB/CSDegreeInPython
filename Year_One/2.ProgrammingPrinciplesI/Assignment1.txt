Assignment One - MetricConversion

Problem Decomposition:

Start by building a simple main function, then copy in the expected output

have main print the expected output as a single string block

def main():
    print("""
    Enter your Name: Brian
    Enter Height in inches: 72
    Enter Weight in pounds: 275

    Metric Calculation
    Name: Brian
    Height: 1.8288036576073152 meters
    Weight: 124.7125 kilograms
    """)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

run the program
$python Assignment1.py
Enter your Name: Brian
Enter Height in inches: 72
Enter Weight in pounds: 275

Metric Calculation
Name: Brian
Height: 1.8288036576073152 meters
Weight: 124.7125 kilograms
This makes sure the main function works

Next, decompose the problem:
build variables name, height, and weight to accept input from the user
replace the string block with variables assigning input and variables in output print statements
name = input("Enter your Name: ") #Brian
height = input("Enter Height in inches: ") #72
weight = input("Enter Weight in pounds: ") #275
print()
print("Metric Calculation")
print("Name: " + name) #Brian
print("Height: " + height + " meters") #72
print("Weight: " + weight + " kilograms") #275

run the program
$python Assignment1.py
Enter your Name: $Brian
Enter Height in inches: $72
Enter Weight in pounds: $275

Metric Calculation
Name: Brian
Height: 72 meters
Weight: 275 kilograms

This makes sure input and variable assignments work

Finally, convert the input values to metric

def convertInchToMeter(value):
    return float(value) * 0.0254

def convertPoundsToKilos(value):
    return float(value) * 0.4535

and change the output print statements to accept non-string values from the new functions

    print("Height:", convertInchToMeter(height), "meters") #1.8288036576073152
    print("Weight:", convertPoundsToKilos(weight), "kilograms") #124.7125

run the complete program and test results
