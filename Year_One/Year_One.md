## About Year One
Your first year of CS work is all about learning basic stuff. 

In an introductory class, you to learn what a datatype is then the different datatypes available in your programming language. Then you learn how to use conditional logic, mostly loops, if-statements, and switch-statements. You might get an introduction into libraries and functions.

In programming principles, you are learning how to write simple programs that do more than one thing while also learning fundamental principles that apply across all programming languages:
*   KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
*   DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
*   SOLID
    *   Single responsibility
    *   Open-closed
    *   Liskov substitution
    *   Interface Segregation
    *   Dependency inversion
*   YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It
*   Composition Over Inheritance
*   Separation of Concerns
*   Document Your Code (Or write code that doesn't require documentation)
*   Refactor
*   Clean Code

Once you get into object-oriented programming, you learn to apply basic design patterns, unit testing and versioning. You also get your first glimpse into common algorithms used in industry, how to work within the Software Development Life-Cycle, and how to build and run unit tests. General topics include:
*   Design Patterns
    *   Strategy
    *   Observer
    *   Factory
    *   Singleton
    *   Command
    *   Template Method
    *   Iterator and Composite
    *   Model View Controller (MVC)
    *   Flyweight 
*   Pillars of OO
*   SOLID Principles
*   Code Smells
*   Refactoring
*   Software Life-Cycle
*   Unit Testing Fundamentals
*   Code Versioning Fundamentals
*   UML Class Diagrams

I've included some math courses in this section because this is typically the level of math necessary cor core CS degree classes (though calculus is needed for students interested in graphics).
