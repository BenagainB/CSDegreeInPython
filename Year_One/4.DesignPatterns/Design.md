# Design Patterns / Object-Oriented Programming

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_One/Year_One.md)

## Section Description

This course covers fundamental abstract concepts of object-oriented programming as well as their implementation in a programming language. Students will learn to apply a fundamental set of design patterns utilizing object-oriented principles to solve real world software design problems.  Students will be become better object-oriented programmers, as well as become better at object-oriented analysis and design.  Students will work individually on fundamentals of design patterns.  Students will also work using Java or C# where multiple design patterns will be applied.  Students will learn the mechanics of unit testing and versioning.  Students will utilize these skills to work on a small team-based project.

## Learning Outcomes 
*   Write a basic program with multiple design patterns that models familiar computational behavior whose implementation is likely not familiar or understood
*   Interpret requirements and specifications, get clarification on anything unknown or uncertain, and translate them into a solution
*   Make use of industry-standard data formats to become familiar with processing them in a flexible manner through design patterns
*   Develop a structurally complex solution using design patterns to manipulate realistic language-based programming constructs
*   Accommodate and enforce appropriate interconnections among a relatively large set of heterogeneous object types with various constraints
*   Develop a software solution in a team environment that utilizes versioning for code organization amongst team members
*   Develop a software solution in a team environment that utilizes unit tests to validate important methods, modules, and components that are part of the solution
