# Programming Principles II

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_One/Year_One.md)

## Section Description

This course continues coverage of concepts introduced in Programming Principles I. Topics include composition, recursion, data abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, inner classes, abstract classes, object cloning, array lists, linked lists and exception handling. Programming projects are required.

## Prerequisites

Programming Principles I and a fair understanding of basic Algebra

        *	Class hierarchies
    *	Object as base of all classes
    *	Protected visibility vs. private visibility
    *	Calling base class constructor
    *	Calling base class methods via super
    *	Abstract base class
    *	Interfaces
*   Exceptions: 
    *	Basic exception handling hierarchy
    *	Checked vs unchecked
    *	Handled versus unhandled exceptions
    *	Try/catch 
    *	Creating own exception class
*   Recursion: 
    *	Recursion in math
    *	Recursion vs. iteration
    *	Cost/benefit analysis
    *	Base and recursive cases
    *	Stack frames
    *	Algorithms that utilize recursion 
*   Linked Lists: 
    *	List as an ADT 
    *	Node class
    *	Basic list operations
    *	Basic linked list class
    *	Linked lists versus array 
    *	Searching and sorting
*   Java API tools: 
    *	Container classes
    *	Collection classes


### Key Concepts:
*   

## Learning Outcomes 
*   insert and/or remove a node from a singly-linked list
*   write, compile and execute a complete program that will simulate a “has-a” relationship
*   design a program implementing inheritance and polymorphism
*   understand and implement a program that uses recursion to solve a problem
*   understand exception processing/handling
