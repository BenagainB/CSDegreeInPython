# Introduction to Programming

[<< Go back up a level](/Year_One/Year_One.md)

## Section Description

Learn fundamental programming concepts, programming environment topics and current technologies in computing. Programming concepts include structure and design using pseudo-code, basic syntax, variables, arithmetic, decisions, repetition, input and output. Programming environment topics include editor use, saving, compiling, running and debugging. Programming projects are required.

## Prerequisites
Fair understanding of basic Algebra and Order of Operations

## Suggested book 

> *Starting Out with Python* (4th Edition) by Tony Gaddis • ISBN-10:0134444329 • ISBN-13:9780134444321

## Topics Covered 

A successful student will understand the concepts and practices of problem solving, developing algorithms and writing computer programs using an imperative programming language. 

### Key Concepts:

*   Difference between computer and calculator
*	Significance of Moore’s law
*	Computer Language
    * High-Level vs. Low-Level Language
    * Compiler vs. Interpreter
*   Definition of Algorithm
*   Hardware/Software definitions
*   Decomposition (Breaking down problem into small steps)
*   Pseudocode
*   Flowcharting
*	Boolean logic
*	Python Logical Operators (== != > < >= <= not and or)
*   Selection structures (if/elif/else)
*   Nesting
*   Boolean variables (type: bool)
*   Loops (condition-controlled and count-controlled)
*   Indention
*	Define functions (def funcName():)
*	Calling a function
*   Arguments and Variables
*	Passing values to functions
*	Return value from functions (return val)
*	Variable scoping in functions
*   Reading from the console
*   Reading from a file
*   Exceptions
*   Lists and Tuples





## Learning Outcomes 

*   Understand arithmetical order of operations.
*   Understand Boolean logic and Boolean operations.
*   Understand program flow by using selection and iteration.
*   Understand how to implement and use functions/methods.
*   Understand how to open, close and use files.
*   Understand basic exception handling.
